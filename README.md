# üíä eChanneling

This is my individual part of the [eChanneling](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.echannelling.mobilechannelling)  mobile application UI / UX improvement and development project for User Experience Engineering module - 3rd year 2nd Semester where you have to select already existing mobile application (From Google PlayStore or anywhere) and improve the UI/UX of the mobile application.<br> 

So we have choose eChanneling mobile application, where I implemented:<br>

- Uploading patient's prescription details and lab test details.<br>
- Purchasing the patient's drugs by selecting a preferred payment method.<br>
- Viewing the user given drug details.<br>

Main focus of the project development is to improve user Experience by re-organization of the UI components and elements as convenient to the end-user as possible and changes to the color-schema.<br>

For the implementation, technology used is Java as the programming language and Android Studio as the IDE.
